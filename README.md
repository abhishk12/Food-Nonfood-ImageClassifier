# Introduction

The aim of this project is to classify images as a **Food image** or **Non-food** image. The model checks if there is any food product in the image or not. The algorithm used for the binary classification is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Training of the model was done on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/ "Google Colab") using GPU runtime and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") which is a free platform as a service (PaaS) cloud platform to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The accuracy of the model is around 86%.
